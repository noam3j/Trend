        \nHere are the basics to being #trendy.
        \nOutfits are referred to as Looks, and your favorite Looks are referred to as Gems ( ).
        \n\nThe Add icon ( ) allows you to take a photo of your current Look.
        \nThe Calendar icon ( ) brings you to a page where you can check past Looks:
        \n• A shaded day ( ) indicates a Look was recorded
        \n• A blank day ( ) has no recorded Look
        \n• A pink square ( ) means that a Gem was created on that day
        \n\nPretty simple huh?
        \nIf you have any other questions or comments check out our Facebook page! Stay #Trendy. </string>
